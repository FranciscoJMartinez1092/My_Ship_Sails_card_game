# My_Ship_Sails_card_game
In this game you play with three computers. Each player is dealt 7 random cards from a 52 card deck. Each player then discards one card from their hand and then picks the card discarded from the player on his right. The game continues till a player wins by having all the cards in his hand from the same suit.
